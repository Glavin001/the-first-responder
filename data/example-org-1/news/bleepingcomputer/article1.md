Mortgage lenders and related companies are becoming popular targets of ransomware gangs, with four companies in this sector recently attacked.

This week, we learned that mortgage lender loanDepot suffered a cyberattack, which the company later confirmed was ransomware.
This comes on the heels of similar attacks against Mortgage giant Mr. Cooper, which led to the exposure of data for 14 million people, and attacks on title insurance companies, including First American Financial and Fidelity National Financial.
As these companies obtain a large amount of sensitive information from their customers, they become attractive targets for ransomware gangs to conduct double-extortion attacks.

Other attacks we learned about this week include the Toronto Zoo, a Black Hunt ransomware attack on Tigo Business, and LockBit claiming to be behind the attack on the Capital Health hospital network.

Finland is also warning of Akira ransomware increasingly targeting companies in the country and wiping backups.
Cybersecurity researchers are back from the holidays, sharing new research on a BlackBasta affiliate's use of PikaBot, Microsoft SQL servers being targeted by the Mimic ransomware, and threat actors impersonating security researchers to offer victims a chance to hack back at ransomware gangs.

For some good news, a Dutch police operation with Cisco Talos led to the arrest of a ransomware operator and the retrieval of decryption keys. This key was added to Avast's decryptor, allowing victims of the Tortilla ransomware (based on Babuk) to recover their files for free.
