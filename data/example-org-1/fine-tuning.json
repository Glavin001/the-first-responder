TeamCity Cloud was not affected.\nThe TeamCity team released the 2023.05.4 fix for the issue.\nWe created a plugin that works for older TeamCity versions (8.0+) and recommended installing it to all customers who could not upgrade quickly enough.\nWe notified all TeamCity On-Premises customers about the vulnerability.\nThe issue was publicly announced.\nActions taken by the TeamCity team\nOn September 6, 2023, we received a report from Sonar regarding a critical vulnerability issue identified in TeamCity On-Premises. If abused, the flaw could enable an unauthenticated attacker with HTTP(S) access to a TeamCity server to perform a remote code execution (RCE) attack and gain administrative control of the TeamCity server. \n\nWe confirmed receiving the report on the same day and proceeded with the internal investigation. On September 14, 2023, we reported back to Sonar. We confirmed it to be a major security issue and stated that we had reproduced the issue and prepared a fix for it. Please refer to the Sonar blog post for technical details about how the issue can be reproduced.\n\nWe then proceeded with handling the issue. On September 18, 2023, we released version 2023.05.4 that contained a fix for the issue. We also created a plugin for older TeamCity versions (8.0+). Thanks to the plugin, any customers who were unable to update to the latest TeamCity version could still apply the fix.\n\nThe plugin can be downloaded here:\n\nVersions prior to 2018.1 \u2013- https:\/\/download.jetbrains.com\/teamcity\/plugins\/internal\/CVE-2023-42793-fix-2018-1.zip. \nVersions 2018.2+ \u2013 https:\/\/download.jetbrains.com\/teamcity\/plugins\/internal\/CVE-2023-42793-fix-recent-versions.zip. \nWe then notified TeamCity Enterprise customers about the issue, encouraging them to update their servers to the latest version, 2023.05.4, which can be found here: https:\/\/www.jetbrains.com\/teamcity\/download\/other.html. \n\nAfter that, the issue was publicly announced on September 21, 2023. Both the Sonar and TeamCity teams published blog posts about the discovered vulnerabilities.\n\nWe\u2019d like to thank the Sonar team for discovering the issue and their collaboration on the public announcement.",
