## Description
The WP Downgrade WordPress plugin, before version 1.2.3, only performed client-side validation of its "WordPress Target Version" settings. However, it did not sanitize and escape the setting server-side. This allowed high privilege users, such as admins, to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks even when the `unfiltered_html` capability was disallowed.
